Le cafe is all about being an superior restaurant in the city which delievers food online to all the customers through its website 
but as the work increases now it has also added different other small samll restaurants who dont host an offical website but have some quality
dishes in their menu so le cafe approaches such restaurant managers and then offers them that they can also add up their food items
on the offical website of le cafe and when the order of that particular dish of their restaurant gets ordered they can check that out and 
deliever the food to that person and by this both the bussiness of le cafe and that particular restaurant will increase.
